When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party 
is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it 
is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return 
true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.
